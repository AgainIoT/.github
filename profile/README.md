# AgainIoT(또이오티)

## Introducing the team
Hello! We're **Team AgainIoT**!<br>
Team **AgainIoT** was formed by gathering people who became close at the first semester of 2022 **IoT Introductory Study** held at the OpenSource Software Society (KOSS), an OpenSource Software academic club affiliated with Kookmin University's Software Convergence College, and when I met them in club activities, I found out that "**IoT Study Again!**" and was given the name of AgainIoT. <br><br>
안녕하세요! 저희는 **팀 또이오티**입니다! <br>
팀 **또이오티**는 국민대학교 소프트웨어융합대학 소속 OpenSource Software 학술 동아리인 **KOSS(Kookmin Univ. OpenSource Software Society)** 에서 진행되었던 2022년 1학기 **IoT 입문 스터디**에서 친해진 사람들끼리 모여서 구성되었고, 동아리 활동에서 만나고 보니 “**또 아이오티(IoT)!**”해서 또이오티라는 이름이 붙여졌습니다.
